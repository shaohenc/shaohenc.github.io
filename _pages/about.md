## Brief Bio:
My research interest lies at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum information, and many-body physics. 

I obtained my **BSc. Physics (2021)** and **MSc. Physics (2023)** from the National University of Singapore, and my **MSc. Engineering/diplôme d'ingénieur (2023)** from Mines Paris-PSL, as a part of the [NUS French Double Degree Programme](https://fddp.nus.edu.sg/index.html).

I am currently a Quantum Computing Scientist at Entropica Labs working on quantum algorithms for optimization applications and fault-tolerant quantum error correction.
