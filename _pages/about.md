My research interest lies at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum information, and many-body physics. 

I obtained my **BSc. Physics (2021)** and **MSc. Physics (2023)** from the National University of Singapore, and my **MSc. Engineering/diplôme d'ingénieur (2023)** from Mines Paris-PSL, as a part of the concurrent Masters [NUS French Double Degree Programme](https://fddp.nus.edu.sg/index.html).

## Current employment:
---

I have been working full-time with Entropica Labs since Sept 2021, and am currently a Senior Quantum Computing Scientist working on quantum algorithms for optimization applications and fault-tolerant quantum error correction. The main scopes of my work are the research, development and implementation of near-term quantum algorithms, error-mitigation techniques, and error-correction codes on existing quantum hardware (with emphasis on superconducting qubit and ion trap platforms), usually towards patents and scientific publications. I also develop software tools in Python for quantum algorithms and quantum error-correction, such as [OpenQAOA](https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/).
